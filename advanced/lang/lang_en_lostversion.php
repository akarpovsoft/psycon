<b>REIKI By Summer</b><br><br>
<b>WHAT IS REIKI?</b><br><br>
Reiki is an alternative healing system that was
developed in the far east many centuries ago. The
Reiki practitioner acts as a channel for Universal
Energy known as prana, chi, or Holy Spirit to heal the
seeker in body, mind, and spirit.<br><br>

<b>HOW DOES REIKI WORK?</b><br><br>

The Universal Life Force flows through our bodies
through chakras which are energy centers in our
bodies. When illness and stress throw our bodies off
balance, reiki can be used to correct and heal this
condition. Channeled energy can be used to remove
blocks and turn negative energies into positive. In
other words, Reiki can be used to heal the pathways of
energy to allow the life force to flow easily and
naturally.<br><br>

<b>WHAT CAN REIKI BE USED FOR?</b><br><br>

Reiki can be used to heal the body, the mind, and the
spirit. It can be used to heal medical conditions
(although it's best to do this in conjunction with a
medical doctor). It can be used to heal emotional
traumas. It can be used to remove blockages that stop
us from moving forward. Most importantly, it can be
used to heal the spirit.<br><br>

<b>HOW DOES ONE BECOME A REIKI HEALER?</b><br><br>

This is achieved through study and attunements with a
Reiki Master. Anyone has the ability to become a
Reiki healer. All it takes is a sincere desire to
help others.<br><br>

<b>HOW CAN YOU BENEFIT FROM REIKI?</b><br><br>

Are you physically exhausted from life's stresses?
Are you emotionally drained from relationships and
interacting with others? Do you feel the need to
develop yourself spiritually? If you answer yes to
any of these questions, I suggest seeking the guidance
of the many gifted healers right here on Psychic
Contact. Their expertise and genuine caring will help
to put you on the right path.<br><br>

Blessings to you!<br /><br />



<b>Symptoms of Spiritual Awakening and Weight Gain by Ianna</b><br><br>

Weight gain in North America is phenomenal. However, this weight gain may not be just due to over eating, lack of exercise, but rather a symptom related to fears we may have suppressed, now coming to the surface to be healed. We react to fears by building up defenses, psychologically, emotionally, and physically. We also attempt to ground ourselves or provide bulk against increasing frequencies in our body. Instead of berating yourself, accept it as a symptom of where you are right now. You will release the weight when fears have been integrated. Then you may find it easier to lose weight eventually. Before eating, try this. Sit at the table with an attractive place setting, candle, and enjoy how the food looks. Tell your body that you are going to use the food to richly nourish, but you are not going to use it for emotional hunger. Pass your hand from left to right over the food and bless it. You may notice that the food feels warm to you hand even though it may be cold. Food is good for you when it feels warm and nourishing to your hand. If you bless the food you may also find you do not eat as much. Another thing to do is stay present while eating and not watch TV, read, or other distractions. This way you enjoy the food more giving you a sense to gratitude. <br><br>



<b>YOUR HIGHER SELF CAN HEAL YOU by Merlin</b><br><br>

There is a part of you that is spirit, part of you that connects you to the spirit world, and a part of you can heal you. The Higher Self is a New Age term for the part of you that is anointed, what Jung called the collective unconscious, the deepest part of the unconscious. Although most people in the New Age community have heard of the Higher Self, few know how to use it for any practical purpose. There are many ways in which to use the Higher Self, but I have time here to only touch on one of them - how to use your Higher Self for healing.<br><br>

The first thing that you need to do is get into a deep meditative state. You might want to make a tape of the rest of this so that you can focus on your imagery and not on reading, or trying to go back and forth between the two.
<br><br>
Once you are in a deep meditative state, feel yourself floating up. See yourself going higher and higher. You pass through the clouds and continue to climb, seeing a tall mountain top. You go higher still and land on the top of that mountain, finding a green pasture there. Stonehenge stands before you and in the direct center of this structure, floating about five feet above the tallest stone, is a sphere of pure white light. You enter the scared assembly of stones.<br><br>

The sphere of pure white light pulsates and becomes brighter as you near it. You stop directly under it. The sphere comes down slowly, cocooning your body in white light. You chant:<br><br>
I am one with my Higher Self, my Higher Self and I am are one.<br><br>
You shall feel your body tingling with energy if you did this right. Now chant a few times:<br><br>
I am my Higher Self.<br><br>
Your energy level should now be soaring. Now chant as you chant AUM:<br><br>
I am that I am.<br><br>
Your energy level should be skyrocketing at this point. Now focus on the area of your body where you want healing. See golden light there. Ask your Higher Self to send healing energy to this area. You will feel a tingling sensation there. Wait until it stops and then thank your Higher Self. Come out of your meditation and know that a change has occurred.<br><br>



<b>FINDING (AND KEEPING) LOVE By Summer</b><br><br>

In my many years of giving readings (don't ask how many!) I've noticed that love is the predominant concern. Why is Love so hard to find and so hard to hold onto? Sometimes all it takes is an added boost to direct loving energies in your direction. Here are some suggestions:<br><br>

<b>CRYSTALS</b><br>
Each type of crystal is endowed with certain powers. Putting crystals into your environment attracts the energy associated with the crystal. For instance, Rose Quartz is an excellent crystal for love and romance. Carry one with you at all times or have one at home and you'll notice much more love surrounding you.<br><br>

<b>FENG SHUI</b><br>
Feng Shui is the ancient Chinese art of placement. Each area of the home represents an area of life. The Relationship area is the far right hand corner of your
home. Decorate this area with things that remind you of love - pictures of couples, pretty flowers, something from your special someone, a picture of an engagement ring, rose quartz of course - you get the idea!<br><br>

<b>POSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS</b><br>
If you're not clear, the Universe won't know what you want. Create an affirmation to bring your soul mate to you. For example, 'My ideal love partner and I are
connected in our minds, hearts, bodies, and spirits, now and always.' Make using positive affirmations a daily practice and do it often.<br><br>

<b>SPELLS AND CANDLE BURNING</b><br>
Spells and Candle Burning are very powerful tools for manifesting what you want. Although anyone can follow these practices, it's usually best to seek out the services of someone skilled in these areas.<br><br>

<b>COMPATIBILITIES AND TIMING</b><br>
When will you meet your soulmate? Is the person I just met right for me? Astrology can be used to answer these important questions and guide you to the
right person at the right time.<br><br>

<b>PSYCHIC READINGS</b><br>
A reading with an accurate, honest and caring psychic can put you on the right path, the path that promises a lifetime of happiness with your beloved soul mate.<br><br>

<b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b><br>
Try some or all of the above methods. Right here on Psychic Contact there are gifted psychics, outstanding astrologers, and master spell crafters who can help you to fulfill your desire for love and romance.<br><br>

Blessings to you!</p>";

<font face="Arial"><b>Q: <i>How many Free Readings can I request?</i></b></font></span></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;A: 
One per visitor\Email address only - please!</font></p>
<p align="center"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="Arial"><b>Q: 
<i>Why 
do I have to give my credit card # in order to receive my Free Reading?</i></b></font></span></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">A: 
Since we offer only one Free Reading per visitor\email address- and due to the 
fact that many ISPs (like AOL) allow you to have more than one email address- 
we have to be able to track the amount of times a person requests and\or receives 
a Free Reading - the only way to do this is to verify who you are by your credit 
card # <br>
<br>
<b>NOTE: YOU WILL <u>NOT</u> BE CHARGED ANYTHING 
ON YOUR CREDIT CARD BY FILLING OUT AND SUBMITTING THE "FREEBIE REQUEST" 
FORM!!!</b><br>
NO CHARGES WILL APPEAR ON YOUR CREDIT CARD STATEMENT AT ANY TIME - no monthly 
charge, no membership charges - none at all! <br>
<b><i>The 
only time you will be charged by this site is <u>if</u> you purchase a Reading! </i></b>

I be charged anything at all for receiving my free Reading?<br>
</i>

A: &nbsp;As stated above: <u>No!</u> <br>
<b>Only

purchase a Reading will a charge appear on your credit card statement.

<i>How 
Soon will I receive my Reading?<br>
</i> 
</b></font></span><font face="Arial"><br>
A: Usually you can be set up within just a few minutes. As long as a Reader 
is online and available. As soon as your credit is validated (<i>not charged!</i>) you can enter any 
available Reader\'s PRIVATE chat room of your choice.</font></p>
<p align="center"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="Arial"><b>Q: 
<i>If 
I lose my connection to the chat room while receiving my Free Reading- will

A: In most cases -Yes! If during your reading you loose your connection within 
7 minutes or less after the Reading began- and the Reader is still available- 
you can return to finish the Reading. <br>
The Reader may also "re-direct" you to an alternate PRIVATE chat room 
system.</font></p>

              <p><strong>Q: Will I be charged anything at all for receiving my free Reading?</strong></p>
              <p>A:  As stated above: No!<br />
                Only if you purchase a Reading will a charge appear on your credit card statement.<br />

              <p>A: Usually you can be set up within just a few minutes. As long as a Reader is online and available. As soon as your credit is validated (not charged!) you can enter any available Reader\'s PRIVATE chat room of your choice.</p>

                The Reader may also &quot;re-direct&quot; you to an alternate PRIVATE chat room system.</p>

              <p>I\'ve been talking with <font color="red">SUMMER</font> for several years now and all of her readings have been valuable, as well as comforting through some rough periods in my life. Her use of Reiki, her ability to tune into my energy, as well as my spirit guides have helped me tune into my own gut feelings and intuition in some difficult "in the moment" situations over the years. She\'s also helped me better notice and interpret energy/signs from my spirit guides within situations that I haven\'t picked up on before. I\'m truly grateful and glad she\'s been here for me and I consider her a friend.<br><br>

This was my first reading with <font color="red">ANGEL</font>. I was absolutely floored when she picked up my grandmother\'s energy around me! She know it was my dad\'s mom. She said that I was my grandma\'s special love (which is exactly what she had said to me when she was alive). She also told me things that my grandma said to her about the hospital that were exactly what she had said to me before she passed away. And the last thing that was incredible was my grandma gave her a name of a man that I had never mentioned but was thinking about. <font color="red">Angel</font> is truly gifted!!!! I am still in awe at her gift!<br><br>

<font color="red">GYPSY</font> you are one of the most genuine readers I\'ve ever come across, you picked up on everything that was bothering me and hit the nail on the head each time.. i will definitely be coming back to u again.. thank you for all your help, it was much appreciated.

<font color="red">KISMET</font> has been helping me remain sane and successful for many years, with her incredible accuracy and humane approach. If you want to be treated with respect and hear the truth, look no further.<br><br>

<font color="red">AURORA</font> was amazing - she was straight to the point and did not waste any time. She knows what\'s in your heart and tells you the truth!! I highly recommend her to anyone.<br><br>

"Chatting with <font color="red">KAT</font> about my life is like talking w/a very close confidant and friend-the only difference is somehow <font color="red">Kat</font> knows & understands, through the help of her so very reliable guides, more than even my closest friends do. Her insights are uncanny-almost otherworldly as others here have observed. I have now had several readings by her and every time it\'s like she can see the people I\'m talking about-she picks up little nuances about the situations and personalities around me that even I, perceptive as I like to think I am, miss. She remembers details from our prior readings too, so I hardly ever have to repeat myself. Best of all, <font color="red">Kat</font> just says it as it is. She\'s a very perceptive and wise counselor, guide and caring friend. Never once have I walked away feeling discouraged. Thank you so much, <font color="red">Kat!</font>"<br><br>

<font color="red">IANNA</font> is a wonderful teacher who is very caring and to the point. She has a great understanding of human nature and uses it well in her readings! She was dead on, detailed, informative and has the ability to hone in quickly discovering issues with ease. If you\'re looking for an honest reading, I highly recommend her. Thank- You!<br><br>

<font color="red">WICCAN1</font> was accurate about things I did not tell her and confirmed what another reader told me to look out for.<br><br>

Oh <font color="red">STAR</font>, thank you! You have truly been a shining light helping me through the recent dark time in my relationship. Your advice and intuition were right on! And the connection you have with your Tarot cards is magical. You said he would call me in 3 days, and he did! I don\'t think our relationship would have lasted with out your insight and intuition to help guide me Thank you for teaching me to recognize my own intuition. You\'ll be talking with me often!
<br><br>
I have been talking with <font color="red">HAVEN</font> for few years already, she is always So Good; always. It is very easy to tell if the psychic is real or not; first you can feel it; second did they ask you many questions. <font color="red">Haven</font> almost never ask question but then start typing right away. And time tells me, she is really gifted. Not just the prediction is true, she is a very caring friend. Many times when i was in the dark, thanks for her hand to pull me back and show me the light at the end of the tunnel. Thanks again and again; she will be my life long friend. Highly recommend her to everyone who has question in their life. Thanks <font color="red">Haven</font>.<br><br>

<font color="red">MOONBEAN</font> is Very intuitive and sensitive, I have a new perspective now, thanks <font color="red">Moon</font>.<br><br>

"I have been working with <font color="red">SAFIRE</font> closely since last summer and every time I speak to her I am continuously blown away with her readings. She is so AMAZING and UNBELIEVABLY accurate. She has yet to guide in me in the wrong direction. Most importantly she doesn\'t give you vague replies and you don\'t have to feed her a lot information to get something out. I would definitely recommend anyone who needs guidance to contact her for a personal reading."<br><br>

<font color="red">MERLIN</font> is a very accurate reader; ask the right questions and he will be straight with you.<br><br>

<font color="red">NAMASTE</font> is unbelievable. She has done at least 10 readings for me since August. As far as I can tell, she has been 100 percent accurate on all relevant points. I wanted to know about moving to another location before I really had formed a plan - she said April - and I am moving March 28. I have asked her about a lot of health issues, specifically recently about something on my back, which looked like a mole that changed color. She said it was nothing, and she was right. She has pointed out a lot of food and diet irregularities, and once I tried her suggestions, I felt better. When I\'ve had problems with my marriage, with issues that my husband and I disagreed with, she was quick to point out that my husband had reasons for what he was talking about, and even tho my emotions led me to believe he was wrong, in the long run, he was right (I hate to admit that!) Even speaking with her, if I\'m in a indecisive, irritable mood, she balances me out. Very wise, very spiritual. And a great communicator... And if I were launching a website, I would definitely hire her, for Tarot, for Astrology, or Numerology. So she would be the first person I would turn to if I had a question, and I still do.<br><br>

<font color="red">EVE</font>, Thank You So Much for always being there to work your magic each week in doing our Angel readings. We have learned a lot about ourselves, the words are always heartfelt words of guidance which we believed helped our life so much this past year.
</p>';

Apparently you are having trouble ordering a chat session due to an<br/>
Address Verification problem<br/><br/>

We suggest doing the following:<br/><br/>

1) try leaving OFF the following items from the way you enter your address:<br/><br/>

"th", "nd" "rd"(as in "3rd" NOT as in road!)<br/><br/>

2) also leave off any Apt # or periods after abbreviated terms<br/>
Example: If you live on an Avenue try entering ave  without the CAP A or the period<br/>
Ave.= not good   ave= ok<br/>

if you live on 3rd street- try entering only the 3<br/>
or if you live on 1st street<br/>
try entering only the 1 not the st with it<br/><br/>

3) Actually the best way to enter your address is by only entering<br/>
your house or building number like so:<br/><br/>

Example: your address is 1234 S. Main St.<br/>
instead of entering the info like that<br/>
try this instead:<br/>
1234<br/><br/>

if the above method still fails try like this:<br/>
1234 s main st<br/><br/>

thats all you probably need to do to get it to work!! OF COURSE YOU MUST STILL ENTER IN YOUR CITY, STATE and ZIP etc<br/><br/>

Despite the fact that you are probably entering your address EXACTLY as it appears on your bank card statement- when it comes to the AVS gateway system on the internet- things change!<br/><br/>

Usually leaving off the extra stuff helps!<br/><br/>

4) For PO BOX addresses:<br/>
type in lower case without the periods<br/>
like so: po box 1234<br/>
if that fails: try leaving off the words po box altogether<br/><br/>

5) REMEMBER YOU CAN ONLY TRY ORDERING 4X IN A 24HR PERIOD!<br/><br/>

 So If all else fails- PLEASE TRY TO ORDER USING PAYPAL<br/> 
(link to paypal is on the fund your account form)<br/><br/>

Thank You<br/>
